# Sidewalk Analysis

## Description
Have you ever thought about why sidewalks, specially in third-world countries, are so deficient
with little to no walkable space and plenty obstacles on the way?

We have thought about it too. 

That is the reason the main goal of this project is to use artificial intelligence tools, more specifically
computer vision models, to segment, detect and calculate the width of sidewalks and potential
obstacles that might be in a pedestrian's way.

We will also integrate our work with Google Maps' Static View API so it will be possible to apply our final
model in any location you would like just by searching an address or latitude/longitude coordinates

## Installation
First of all you have to clone this repo via ```git clone https://github.com/juanocv/sidewalk_analysis.git```

Secondly, you *must* install [detectron2](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/install.html), [OneFormer](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/OneFormer/blob/main/INSTALL.md) and their respective dependencies in the same folder you have cloned this repo.

Finally, you are good to go
